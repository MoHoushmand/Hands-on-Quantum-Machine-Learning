It sounds like a harsh boundary between a quantum and a classical system that can only be bridged by measurement. The reality is more subtle: unless a quantum system is perfectly isolated, it interacts with its surrounding environment. This leads to introduction of mixed states, which in one limit recover classical probabilities.\n",

Together they form the bra-ket or Dirac notation. A bra is the conjugate transpose of a ket, and the other way around. This also means that a bra is a row vector.

    "A measurement in quantum mechanics is an operator-valued random variable. The theory of measurements is rich and countless questions about them are still waiting to be answered. Most quantum computers that we have today, however, only implement one very specific measurement, which makes our discussion a lot simpler. This measurement is in the canonical basis. In other words, the measurement contains two projections, $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle 1|$, and this measurement can be applied to any of the qubits of the quantum computer.\n",

For instance, for some state $|\\psi\\rangle$, we get a scalar for $\\langle\\psi|0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\psi\\rangle$. This is called the expectation value of the operator $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$. To put this in context, let us apply the projection $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$ on the superposition $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$, which is the column vector $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$."

    "We only observe 00 and 11. Since the state is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)$, this should not come as a shock. Yet, there is something remarkable going on here. At the end of the last section, we saw the same statistics, but from measurements on the same qubit. Now we have two, spatially separate qubits exhibiting the same behaviour: this is a very strong form of correlations. This means that if we measure just one qubit, and get, say, 0 as the outcome, we *know* with certainty that if we measured the other qubit, we would also get 0, even though the second measurement is also a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To appreciate this better, imagine that your are tossing two unbiased coins. If you observe heads on one, there is absolutely nothing that you can say about what the other one might be other than a wild guess that holds with probability 0.5. If you play foul and you biased the coins, you might improve your guessing accuracy. Yet you can never say with certainty what the other coin will be based on the outcome you observed on one coin, except for the trivial case when the other coin deterministically gives the same face always.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkable as it is, there is no activation or instantaneous (faster than the speed of light) signalling happening between the qubits, though. Your measurement was local to the qubit and so is your information. If there is somebody else doing the measurement on the other qubit, you would have to inform the person through classical communication channels that you happen to know what the outcome will be. So while we certainly cannot violate the theory of relativity with entanglement, this strong form of correlation is still central to many quantum algorithms."

    "If all was clear until now, this is where it gets messy. A ket and a bra is a projection, as we explained above. More than that, it is also a density matrix. A density matrix is another way of writing a quantum state, instead of kets. So, for instance we could write $\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$, where $\\rho$ is the density matrix for $|\\psi\\rangle$. The Born rule still applies, but now we have to take the trace of the result: for instance, $\\mathrm{Tr}[|0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\rho]$ would be the probability of seeing 0. See it in action:"

    "The off-diagonal elements are gone in the second case. The off-diagonal elements are also called coherences: their presence indicates that the state is quantum. The smaller these values are, the closer the quantum state is to a classical probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second density matrix above has only diagonal elements and they are equal: this is the equivalent way of writing a uniform distribution. We know that the uniform distribution has maximum entropy, and for this reason, a density matrix with this structure is called a maximally mixed state. In other words, we are perfectly ignorant of which elements of the canonical basis constitute the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like a quantum state to be perfectly isolated from the environment, but in reality, the quantum computers we have today and for the next couple of years cannot achieve a high degree of isolation. So coherences are slowly lost to the environment -- this is a process called decoherence. The speed at which this happens determines the length of the quantum algorithms we can run on the quantum computer: if it happens fast, we have time to apply a handful gates or do any other form calculation, and then we quickly have to pull out (measure) the results."
